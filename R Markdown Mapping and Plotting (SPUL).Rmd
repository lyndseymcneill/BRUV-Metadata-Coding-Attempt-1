### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r packages}
library(maptools)
install.packages("rgdal", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies = TRUE)
library(sp)
install.packages("raster", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com/", dependencies = TRUE)
```

```{r importing shapefiles}
